# minimal-mp3player

Since Godot 3.2.4 beta, the AudioStream element supports mp3 streams. To showcase that (and to get more experience with Godot), this implementation was created. The code aims to be minimal, design is non-existent. Mac, Windows, Linux and Android export binaries are included.

## Features
- implements a mini mp3 player
- requests permission to access media files on Android
- loads files from external sources (i.e. not user:// or res://)
- plays files from the music directory
- no design at all!
